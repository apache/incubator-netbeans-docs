<b>Answer:</b>
        
<p>
            The Ant integration module recognizes Ant build scripts, facilitates
            editing them as text or structurally, lets the user run targets or
            create shortcuts to them, etc.

<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
        
<p>
            The main uses of the Ant integration module are self-contained and do
            not interact directly with other modules: the user selects a target
            in an Ant script and runs it. Nonetheless, there are a few
            significant ways other modules can interact with this module:

<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
        
<p>
            Visible strings directly represented by the module are
            internationalized. However Ant itself is not, and so messages coming
            from Ant will appear only in English.

            Does the module implement or define any standards? Is the 
            implementation exact or does it deviate somehow?
        </em></font>
<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
        
<p>
            Insofar as Ant can be considered a standard, it implements the
            standard behavior of running an Ant script. The implementation should
            behave quite similarly to what the normal Ant command-line usage does
            (since it delegates to the Ant library internally and only replaces
            the command-line wrapper with an IDE wrapper). Since the Ant project
            does not publish a formal specification of how Ant should behave,
            there is no objective criterion for judging the fidelity.
        </p>
        
<p>
            Likely areas of difference between command-line and IDE usage:
            obscure class loader scenarios (since the IDE must load Ant in a
            special class loader, whereas the command-line tool may do it
            differently); system properties set in the IDE but not on the command
            line; etc. Generally, well-written scripts and tasks are not affected
            by these differences, but occasionally problems arise (they are
            treated as bugs).

<b>Answer:</b>
        
<p>
            
<code>java.io.File</code> is used by Ant itself, so the module uses

            Of course, Ant is run (as a VM-internal process). Ant itself handles

<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
        
<p>
            
<code>IntrospectedInfo</code> should be thread-safe and fires changes

            unless otherwise noted. Internal classes follow natural Datasystems,
            Nodes, etc. threading models. Running an Ant target uses the
            execution engine, which spawns a fresh thread.
            <code>AntLogger</code>s are stateless and must be reentrant for multiple threads;
            <code>AntSession</code>s and so on are thread-safe.

        </em></font>
<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
        
<p>
            Most interesting criteria relate to performance of Ant itself, which
            seems fine.
        </p>
        
<p>
            Adding an extra module with custom task definitions add a small
            overhead (10msec?) to launching an Ant script. The time is largely
            spent in Ant itself so is difficult to optimize out.
        </p>
        
<p>
            Adding new <code>AntLogger</code>s will slow down Ant output a little
            bit, but it seems not significantly compared to typical overhead of

<b>Answer:</b>
        
<p>
            The main question is how much memory a build consumes as it runs. Can
            be substantial - will easily keep a default 96Mb heap filled - but
            does not appear to leak. Ant itself mostly uses memory linearly (i.e.
            allocates and soon releases it), except for deeply nested build
            scripts. Tasks which are likely to consume a lot of heap (e.g.
            Javadoc) are typically run as external processes by default.

            Loading introspected info for the Ant installation is a

            Nothing special is done in this regard for most SPIs.

            Installation location shall not matter, if it does explain why.

            Often <code>JComponent.getClientProperty</code>, <code>Action.getValue</code>

            a behavior of some code. This of course forms an interface that should

            Check for cases when you have an object of type A and you also
            expect it to (possibly) be of type B and do some special action. That

            If there is a property that can change the behavior of your

        <question id="exec-threading" when="impl">
            What threading models, if any, does your module adhere to?
            <hint>
                If your module calls foreign APIs which have a specific threading model,
                indicate how you comply with the requirements for multithreaded access
                (synchronization, mutexes, etc.) applicable to those APIs.
                If your module defines any APIs, or has complex internal structures
                that might be used from multiple threads, declare how you protect
                data against concurrent access, race conditions, deadlocks, etc.,
                and whether such rules are enforced by runtime warnings, errors, assertions, etc.
                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might
                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex
                (and may or may not automatically acquire that mutex on behalf of a client method);
                might be able to run only in the event queue; etc.
                Also describe when any events are fired: synchronously, asynchronously, etc.

            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called

            provides uniform access to such resources and is the preferred

            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task

            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API

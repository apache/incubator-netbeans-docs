Please increment the 'version' field of <api-questions> whenever you make a
semantic change: adding a new question or significantly changing the meaning of
an old one. Changing this field ensures that arch pages answering the old version
print a warning during Javadoc generation. If you only change hints or make small
edits in the text of a question, you need not change the version number.

An automated process runs openide/www/tutorial/build.xml#question periodically
and commits any changes to openide/www/tutorial/questions.html.

<!-- Question: exec-reflection

     <question id="exec-reflection">
            Does your code uses java.lang.reflect to execute some other code?
            <hint>
            This usually indicates a missing or unsufficient API in the other
            part of the system. If the other side is not aware of your dependency
            this contract can be easily broken.
            </hint>
        </question>

<!-- Question: format-clipboard

     <question id="format-clipboard">
            Which protocols your code reads/inserts when communicating with
            clipboard?

            Which file formats your code reads or writes on disk?
        </question>
-->




<!-- Question: lookup-lookup

     <question id="lookup-lookup">
            Does your module uses <code>org.openide.util.Lookup</code>
            to find any components to communicate to? Which ones?
            
            <hint>
            Please describe the interfaces you are searching for, where 
            are defined, whether you are searching for just one or more of them,
            if the order is important, etc. Also clasify the stability of such
            API contract.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->




<!-- Question: lookup-register

     <question id="lookup-register">
            Do you register anything into the lookup for other to find? 
            <hint>
            Do you register using layer file or using <code>META-INF/services</code>?
            Who is supposed to find your component?
            </hint>
        </question>
-->




<!-- Question: lookup-remove

     <question id="lookup-remove">
            Are removing entries of other modules from the lookup? 
            <hint>
            Why? Of course, that is possible, but it can be dangerous. Is the module
            your are masking resource from aware of what you are doing?
            </hint>
        </question>
-->




<!-- Question: perf-exit

     <question id="perf-exit">
            Does your module executes anything on exit?
        </question>
-->




<!-- Question: perf-huge_dialogs

     <question id="perf-huge_dialogs">
            Does your module contain any dialogs or wizards with huge
            amount of GUI controls like combo boxes, lists, trees, text
            areas?
        </question>
-->




<!-- Question: perf-limit

     <question id="perf-limit">

<!-- Question: perf-menus

     <question id="perf-menus">
            Does your module use dynamically changing context menus or
            context sensitive actions with complicated logic for enable/disable?
        </question>
-->




<!-- Question: perf-progress

     <question id="perf-progress">
            Does your module executes some long running task?
            <hint>Typically they are tasks like connecting over
            network, computing huge amount of data, compilation.
            Such communication should be done asynchronously (for example
            using <code>RequestProcessor</code>), definitively it should 
            not block AWT thread.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->




<!-- Question: perf-scale

     <question id="perf-scale">
            Which external criteria influence the performance of your
            program (size of file in editor, number of files in menu, 
            in source directory, etc.) and how well your code scales?
            Please include some estimates.
        </question>

<!-- Question: perf-startup

     <question id="perf-startup">

<!-- Question: perf-wakeup

     <question id="perf-wakeup">
            Is any piece of your code waking up periodically?
        </question>
-->




<!-- Question: resources-file

     <question id="resources-file">
            Does your module use <code>java.io.File</code> directly?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the prefered
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when
            this is not suitable.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->




<!-- Question: resources-layer

     <question id="resources-layer">
            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create some files or
            folders on it? What it is trying to communicate by that and with which 
            component?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.). 
            </hint>
        </question>
-->




<!-- Question: resources-mask

     <question id="resources-mask">
            Does your module mask/hide/override any resource provided by another one in
            module layer? 
            
            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->




<!-- Question: resources-read

     <question id="resources-read">
            Does your module read any resources from layers? For what purpose?
            
            <hint>
            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.
            Please describe it and clasify according to 
            <a href="http://openide.netbeans.org/tutorial/api-design.html#categories">
            common stability categories</a>.
            </hint>

            Describe the overall architecture.
            <hint>
            What will be API for
            <a href="http://openide.netbeans.org/tutorial/api-design.html#design.apiandspi" shape="rect">
                clients and what support API</a>?
            What parts will be pluggable?
            How will plug-ins be registered? Please use <code>&lt;api type="export"/&gt;</code>
            to describe your general APIs.
            If possible please provide
            simple diagrams.

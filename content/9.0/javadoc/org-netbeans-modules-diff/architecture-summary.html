Please increment the 'version' field of <api-questions> whenever you make a
semantic change: adding a new question or significantly changing the meaning of
an old one. Changing this field ensures that arch pages answering the old version
print a warning during Javadoc generation. If you only change hints or make small
edits in the text of a question, you need not change the version number.

            What is this project good for?
            
        </em></font>
<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
The diff module provides the ability to visualize differences between source files.
It also has a graphical conflicts resolver tool and built-in patch algorithm.
<p>List of the main features:</p>

<ul>
  
<li>Simple APIs, that provide access to registered diff and merge engines and visualizers.</li>
  
<li>Built in and external diff engines defined.</li>
  
<li>Graphical diff vizualizer and conflicts resolver.</li>
  
<li>Extensible with additional diff and merge engines and vizualizers.</li>
  
<li>Patch algorithm implemented for UNIX-style, unidiff and contextual diff formats.</li>

</ul>

<b>Answer:</b>

     

<h4>Show a diff from action</h4>

<p>
From an action or wherever you like you can call this:
</p>


<pre xml:space="preserve">
public void diff(final StreamSource local, final StreamSource remote){
    SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            try {
                <a href="org/netbeans/api/diff/DiffView.html" shape="rect">DiffView</a> view = <a href="org/netbeans/api/diff/Diff.html" shape="rect">Diff</a>.getDefault().createDiff(local, remote);
                showDiff(view);
            } catch (IOException ex) {
                Logger.getLogger(ThisClass.class.getName()).throwing(ex);
            }
        }
    });
}
public void showDiff(final <a href="org/netbeans/api/diff/DiffView.html" shape="rect">DiffView</a> view){
    SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            //create our panel with our view
            //right now I am just going to use the diff component 
            // instead of a panel
            //create a topcomponent with our panel
            DiffTopComponent tc = new DiffTopComponent(view);
            tc.setName("MY_DIFF");
            tc.setDisplayName("Some display name");
            tc.open();
            tc.requestActive();
        }
    });
}
</pre>



<h4>Embeded into TopComponent</h4>

<p>
Here is a top component to display it:
</p>


<pre xml:space="preserve">
public class DiffTopComponent extends <a href="../org-openide-windows/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.html" shape="rect">TopComponent</a> {
&nbsp; &nbsp; /** Creates a new instance of DiffTopComponent */
&nbsp; &nbsp; public DiffTopComponent(Component diffPanel) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; setLayout(new BorderLayout());
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; add(diffPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER);
        getAccessibleContext().setAccessibleName(
            NbBundle.getMessage(DiffTopComponent.class, 
            "ACSN_Diff_Top_Component")); // NOI18N
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
        getAccessibleContext().setAccessibleDescription(
            NbBundle.getMessage(DiffTopComponent.class, 
            "ACSD_Diff_Top_Component")); // NOI18N
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; public DiffTopComponent(DiffView view) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this(view.getComponent());
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; public int getPersistenceType(){
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return TopComponent.PERSISTENCE_NEVER;
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; protected String preferredID(){
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return "DiffTopComponent"; &nbsp; &nbsp;//NOI18N
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; public HelpCtx getHelpCtx() {

<b>Answer:</b>
    The external diff engine expect the standard UNIX-style output of the external
    diff executable.
     
    The patching algorithm supports three diff formats:
<ul>
  
<li>Standard UNIX-style diff format,</li>
  
<li>Unidiff format,</li>
  
<li>Contextual diff format.</li>

            context-sensitive actions with complicated enablement logic?
        </question>
-->




<!--
        <question id="perf-progress">
            Does your module execute any long-running tasks?
            <hint>Typically they are tasks like connecting over
            network, computing huge amount of data, compilation.
            Such communication should be done asynchronously (for example
            using <code>RequestProcessor</code>), definitively it should 
            not block AWT thread.
            </hint>

<!--
        <question id="perf-scale">
            Which external criteria influence the performance of your
            program (size of file in editor, number of files in menu, 
            in source directory, etc.) and how well your code scales?
            Please include some estimates.
        </question>

<!--
        <question id="perf-startup">
            Does your module run any code on startup?
        </question>

<!--
        <question id="perf-wakeup">
            Does any piece of your code wake up periodically and do something
            even when the system is otherwise idle (no user interaction)?
        </question>

<!--
        <question id="resources-file">
            Does your module use <code>java.io.File</code> directly?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the prefered
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when
            this is not suitable.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->




<!--
        <question id="resources-layer">
            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create any files or
            folders in it? What it is trying to communicate by that and with which 
            components?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.). 
            </hint>
        </question>
-->




<!--
        <question id="resources-mask">
            Does your module mask/hide/override any resources provided by other modules in
            their layers?
            
            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file&apos;s name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->




<!--
        <question id="resources-read">
            Does your module read any resources from layers? For what purpose?
            
            <hint>
            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.
            Please describe it and clasify according to 
            <a href="http://openide.netbeans.org/tutorial/api-design.html#categories">

            <hint>
            If you provide an ant task that users can use, you need to be very
            careful about its syntax and behaviour, as it most likely forms an
	          API for end users and as there is a lot of end users, their reaction
            when such API gets broken can be pretty strong.

<!--
        <question id="exec-threading" when="init">
            What threading models, if any, does your module adhere to? How the
            project behaves with respect to threading?
            <hint>
                Is your API threadsafe? Can it be accessed from any threads or
                just from some dedicated ones? Any special relation to AWT and
                its Event Dispatch thread? Also
                if your module calls foreign APIs which have a specific threading model,
                indicate how you comply with the requirements for multithreaded access
                (synchronization, mutexes, etc.) applicable to those APIs.
                If your module defines any APIs, or has complex internal structures
                that might be used from multiple threads, declare how you protect
                data against concurrent access, race conditions, deadlocks, etc.,
                and whether such rules are enforced by runtime warnings, errors, assertions, etc.
                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might
                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex
                (and may or may not automatically acquire that mutex on behalf of a client method);
                might be able to run only in the event queue; etc.
                Also describe when any events are fired: synchronously, asynchronously, etc.

            If you allow foreign code to be plugged into your own module, how
            do you enforce that it will behave correctly and quickly and will not
            negatively influence the performance of your own module?

<!--
        <question id="security-grant" when="final">
            Does your code grant additional rights to some other code?
            <hint>Avoid using a class loader that adds extra
            permissions to loaded code unless really necessary.
            Also note that your API implementation
            can also expose unneeded permissions to enemy code by

        <question id="security-policy" when="final">
            Does your functionality require modifications to the standard policy file?

            coming from trusted domains. This could be code downloaded over the
            network or code coming from libraries that are not bundled
            with NetBeans. Which permissions need to be granted to which domains?</hint>

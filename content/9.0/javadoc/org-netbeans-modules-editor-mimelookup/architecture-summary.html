<h2>General Information</h2>

<font color="gray"><b><a name="answer-arch-what">Question (arch-what)</a>:</b><em>
            What is this project good for?
            
        </em></font>
<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
Each editor provides an EditorKit which controls the policy of specific MIME content type.
The policy of content type should be easily registered and found via some lookup mechanism,
that will provide convenient way of using it either for kit provider or base
editor infrastructure.  In addition to this, the policy can be inherited, (e.g. in case of embeded
kits like JSP) and the content types need to be merged in this case. MIME Lookup API should 
provide all mentioned requierements via easy lookup query, so content type policy 
user need not to solve this searching and merging on its own side.
<p></p>
<font color="gray"><b><a name="answer-arch-overall">Question (arch-overall)</a>:</b><em>
            Describe the overall architecture. 
            
        </em></font>
<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>

It consists of
<ul>
    
<li>
<a href="#java-MimeLookupAPI">MimeLookupAPI</a> in <code>org.netbeans.api.editor.mimelookup</code>
</li>
    
<li>
<a href="#java-MimeLookupSPI">MimeLookupSPI</a> in <code>org.netbeans.spi.editor.mimelookup</code>
</li>

</ul>


<p>API contains only two classes:</p>

1. org.netbeans.api.editor.mimelookup.MimeLookup with public methods:
<ul>
    
<li> 
<code> static MimeLookup getMimeLookup(String mime) </code> - gets mime specific lookup. </li>
    
<li> 
<code> static Lookup getLookup(MimePath mimePath) </code> - gets the lookup for the particular mime-path.</li>
    
<li> 
<code> MimeLookup childLookup(String mime) </code> - gets mime specific child (embeded) lookup. The method was deprecated in favour of 
        static Lookup getLookup(MimePath mimePath) </li>
    
<li> 
<code> Object lookup(Class clazz) </code> - Look up an object matching a given interface. </li>
    
<li> 
<code> Result lookup(Lookup.Template template) </code> - The general lookup method. Callers can get list of all instances and classes
         that match the given <code>template</code> and attach a listener to
         this be notified about changes. </li>

</ul>

<br>
2. org.netbeans.api.editor.mimelookup.MimePath with public methods:
<ul>
    
<li> 
<code> static MimePath get(String mimeType) </code> - gets root mime-path for the given mime-type. </li>
    
<li> 
<code> static MimePath get(MimePath prefix, String mimeType) </code> - gets mime-path corresponding to the mime-type used in the given context
      mime-path.</li>
    
<li> 
<code> static MimePath parse(String path) </code> - parses the given mime-path string
      e.g. "text/x-jsp/text/x-java" and get the corresponding mime-path. </li>
    
<li> 
<code> String getPath() </code> - gets string path represented by this mime-path. </li>
    
<li> 
<code> int size() </code> -gets total number of mime-types in the mime-path. </li>
    
<li> 
<code> String getMimeType(int index) </code> - gets mime type of this mime-path at the given index. </li>
    
<li> 
<code> MimePath getPrefix(int size) </code> - returns prefix mime-path with the given number of mime-type components
      ranging from zero till the size of this mime-path. </li>

</ul>

<br>

<br>

<code>MimeLookup</code> is represented via ProxyLookup that collects registered lookups. Particular lookups, 
responsible for looking up their objects can be registered using interface <code>MimeDataProvider</code> into default lookup
by META-INF/services registration. Previously used registration via interface <code> MimeLookupInitializer</code> was deprecated.<p></p>
In addition to this basic registration, xml layer folder registration is also available. 
It is provided by registering implemented interface <code>Class2LayerFolder</code> into default lookup
 via META-INF/services registration.
This approach provides a mapping of class to specific subfolder. 
Using this mapping one can achieve the convenient way of using <code>MimeLookup</code> e.g.
<p>

<code>
    MimeLookup.getMimeLookup("text/x-java").lookup(FoldManagerFactory.class);
</code>

</p>

<p>
   Using this, an instance of FoldManagerFactory is retrieved from the folder with path 
   "Editors/text/x-java/FoldManager" provided that FoldManagerFactory.class is registered to
   a subfolder "FoldManager" via <code>Class2LayerFolder</code> registration.
</p>

<p></p>
There <code>InstanceProvider</code> can be used if there are files
of various types in the layer folder that need additional handling
before becoming and instance of certain class.
For more details look at use case of PopupActions creation.

<p>
The Javadoc documentation can be generated by using
</p>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
    cd /cvs/editor/mimelookup
    ant javadoc
</pre>

            use cases</a> of the new API. Who will use it under

        </em></font>
<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>


<h4>Per mime-type operation</h4>
Operation of the editor module must be parametrized by the type of the file
being edited. In the past the operation was parametrized by the class
of the editor kit but that did not show up as being useful enough.
<br>
It is more practical to use a string-based parametrization concretely
the mime-type. Anyone can then easily register an additional functionality
for the editor because it's just enough to know the right mime-type and the type
of the functionality class to be implemented and the xml layer folder
where the class should be registered.


<h4>Provide list of instances as lookup result</h4>
On the modules' implementation side the registered functionality 
must be retrieved somehow. It's necessary to instantiate the registered objects
and react to module enabling/disabling which can affect validity of the registered objects.
<br>
As the most convenient solution appears to use
<code>org.openide.util.Lookup</code> allowing to provide
the registered instances as a <code>Lookup.Result</code>
allowing to listen for changes (e.g. caused by the module enabling/disabling).
<br>
This resulted into creation of <code>class MimeLookup extends Lookup</code> containing
<code>static MimeLookup getMimeLookup(String mimeType)</code>.


<h4>Nested mime-types</h4>
On the lexical level the document can contain nested languages.
<br>
For example JSP document can contain pieces of java code which can further contain
javadoc comment tokens with nested javadoc language.
<br>
The nested languages should allow for special settings
such as fonts and colors of nested syntax coloring but even
things like actions that would be active in the nested document section.
<br>
This resulted into creation of
<code>static Lookup getLookup(MimePath mimePath)</code> method in <code>MimeLookup</code>. 


<h4>Known clients summary</h4>

<b>Fold Manager Factories</b>

<br>
The editor/fold module expects to find the registered
fold manager factories (<code>org.netbeans.spi.editor.fold.FoldManagerFactory</code> classes).
<br>

<br>

<b>Completion Providers</b>

<br>
The editor/completion module expects to find the registered
completion providers (<code>org.netbeans.spi.editor.completion.CompletionProvider</code> classes).
<br>

<br>

<b>Editor Context Menu Actions</b>

<br>
The editor module expects to find the registered
popup menu actions (<code>javax.swing.Action</code> classes or names of actions
(i.e. value of Action.NAME attribute) present in editor kit e.g. "goto-source").
<br>

<br>

<b>Side Bars</b>

<br>
The editor/lib module expects to find factories for components to be placed on the 
sides of the editor component (<code>org.netbeans.editor.SideBarFactory</code> classes).
<br>

<br>

<b>Hyperlink Providers</b>

<br>
The editor/lib module expects to find hyperlink providers that allow connecting
an open document with some other documents (<code>org.netbeans.lib.editor.hyperlink.spi.HyperlinkProvider</code> classes).
<br>

<br>

<b>Code Template Processors</b>

<br>
The editor/codetemplates module expects to find factories for code template processors
(<code>org.netbeans.lib.editor.codetemplates.spi.CodeTemplateProcessorFactory</code> classes).
<br>

<br>

<b>Hints Providers</b>

<br>
The editor/hints module expects to find editor hints providers
(<code>org.netbeans.modules.editor.hints.spi.HintsProvider</code> classes).


<br>

<b>
API Use Cases
</b>

<hr>


<h4>Find class instances for the given mime-type</h4>

An API method
<p></p>

<code>
MimeLookup lookup = MimeLookup.getMimeLookup("text/x-java");
</code>

<p></p>
can be used for getting the mime specific lookup. Having this we can lookup class
 or template:
<p></p>

<code>
    Object obj = lookup.lookup(LookedUpClass.class);
</code>

<p></p>
or
<p></p>

<code>
    Lookup.Result result = lookup.lookup(new Lookup.Template(LookedUpClass.class));
</code>



<h4>Getting embeded mime-type specific Lookup</h4>
As an example a jsp scriptlet is used. Scriptlet in fact consists of parent "text/x-jsp" mime-type and
embeded "text/x-java" mime-type. To obtain a scriptlet lookup firstly we need to get a MimePath and then
get appropriate lookup:

<p></p>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
    MimePath scriptletPath = MimePath.parse("text/x-jsp/text/x-java");
    Lookup lookup = MimeLookup.getLookup(scriptletPath);
</pre>




<br>

<b>
SPI Use Cases
</b>

<hr>


<h4>Providing implemented MimeLookupInitializer</h4>
It is the general way of adding mime specific object into the <code>MimeLookup</code>. Implementation of <code>MimeLookupInitializer</code> should be created and
            registered to default lookup via <code>META-INF/services</code> registration.
For details, please look at the simplified 
<code>TestMimeLookupInitializer</code> 
            in <code>mimelookup/test/unit</code> or <code>LayerMimeLookupInitializer</code>.
<b> Usage of MimeLookupInitializer is deprecated, please use MimeDataProvider instead in similar way </b>

        </em></font>
<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
Unit tests are available.
<p></p>
There are several testing areas covered:
<ul>
    
<li> 
<code>MimeLookupTest.java</code>
    
<ul>
    
<li> Looking up the class that has not registered subfolder via <code>Class2LayerFolder</code>.
       It should be found in the appropriate mime-type specific folder</li>
    
<li> Looking up the class that has registered subfolder via <code>Class2LayerFolder</code>
</li>
    
<li> Testing if the <code>MimeLookup</code> is not recursive (see issue #58991 for more details)</li>
    
<li> Testing lazy lookup object creation. Object is instantiated only if it is directly looked up</li>
    
<li> Testing <code>MimeLookupInitializer</code> creation, registration and performing a lookup</li>    
    
</ul>
    
</li>
    
    
<li> 
<code>MimeLookupInheritanceTest.java</code>
    
<ul>
    
<li> Testing the inheritance and instance provider functionality as well as
     sorting of merged elements</li>
    
</ul>
    
</li>
    
    
<li> 
<code>MimeLookupPopupItemsChangeTest.java</code>
    
<ul>
    
<li> Testing the dynamic change (addition or removal of a file [looked-up object] 
        from xml layer folder) in inheritance tree, merging, sorting</li>
    
</ul>
    
</li>
    

</ul>

After fixing the <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=58941" shape="rect"> issue #58941 </a>
unit tests of template lookup should be added. All tests was rewritten and adjusted to newly introduced 
MimePath.

<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
  The module needs (i.e. OpenIDE-Module-Needs) the following token: org.netbeans.spi.editor.mimelookup.MimeDataProvider.
  The implementation of the default <code>MimeDataProvider</code> that serves data
  from the folder hierarchy underneath the Editors/ folder on the system filesystem
  is provided by the editor/mimelookup/impl module. This module also provides the token
  mentioned earlier.

<b>Answer:</b>
Pluggins are just clients lookups that are installed into <code>MimeLookup</code>. The performance
should be influenced by the lookupable object gathering by clients lookups. <code>LayerMimeLookupInitializer</code> 
(client lookup provided by mimelookup module)
provides a LazyLookup, it instantiates the object found in the layer only
during direct lookup of the particular class.
Otherwise performance should be similar as ProxyLookup.

            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number

            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to

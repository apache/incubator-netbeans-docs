                    The context and key <code>OpenIDE/mergeIntoMaster</code> can be set as an attribute on a help set

<p></p>
                     The help window through JDK 1.5.0 handles modal dialogs by reparenting the help 
                     component into a child dialog of any new modal dialog whenever it is shown, and 
                     reparenting it back into a frame whenever it is hidden.  Under certain circumstances
                     (showing two dialogs sequentially before the frame can be re-shown), it can produce
                     a race condition in the underlying java.awt.Toolkit implementation.  As a workaround,
                     callers of DialogDisplayer.getDefault().notify(DialogDescriptor) may set the system
                     property "javahelp.ignore.modality" to the String "true".  This system property will
                     be reset by notify(), and applied as a client property of the root pane of the dialog
                     to be shown.  JavaHelp will, in turn, ignore the appearance of any dialog whose root
                     pane posesses the client property "javahelp.ignore.modality" with the String value
                     "true".

Please increment the 'version' field of <api-questions> whenever you make a
semantic change: adding a new question or significantly changing the meaning of
an old one. Changing this field ensures that arch pages answering the old version
print a warning during Javadoc generation. If you only change hints or make small
edits in the text of a question, you need not change the version number.

An automated process runs openide/www/tutorial/build.xml#question periodically

<b>Answer:</b>
        The JavaHelp integration API wraps the standard JavaHelp extension
        library. It also provides a small additional API for NetBeans modules to
        supply help sets to the system, add GUI menu items, and request that
        particular help topics be displayed.

<b>Answer:</b>
        
<p>
            The JavaHelp extension library (<samp>jh.jar</samp>) is included,
            currently at version 1.1.3.
        </p>
        
<p>
            
<strong>Note</strong> that some versions of Solaris ship with their
            own copy of this library in the location
            <samp>/usr/j2se/opt/javahelp/lib/jhall.jar</samp>. Since this JAR is
            included in the extensions path of the JRE on such machines, it would
            override the copy of <samp>jh.jar</samp> shipped with the NetBeans
            integration module. Normally this would be tolerable, but
            unfortunately the version shipped with Solaris is outdated and
            exhibits a number of serious bugs, especially in the handling of
            Japanese search text, which make the NetBeans help system unusable
            and which were fixed in subsequent official JavaHelp releases. (Note
            that search databases for JavaHelp help sets are often not cleanly
            usable in versions of JavaHelp other than the one in which they were
            built, since details of how HTML substring indices are calculated
            tend to be unstable between even minor releases.) To avoid such bugs,
            the NetBeans launcher checks for the existence of the abovementioned
            file, and if found, prepends the NetBeans <samp>jh.jar</samp> to the
            JVM's boot classpath. Other options were considered and rejected as
            unworkable.

<b>Answer:</b>
        It uses <code>InstalledFileLocator</code> to implement the
        <code>nbdocs</code> URL protocol, permitting help sets or files to be
        loaded from disk files in the NetBeans installation, rather than from

        The layer registers the <code>Help</code> singleton, declares some XML

<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
        Not directly. It uses lookup to find help sets, while providing an XML

<b>Answer:</b>
        No. However the <code>usersguide</code> module does mask the master help

            - 
                     The help window through JDK 1.5.0 handles modal dialogs by reparenting the help 
                     component into a child dialog of any new modal dialog whenever it is shown, and 
                     reparenting it back into a frame whenever it is hidden.  Under certain circumstances
                     (showing two dialogs sequentially before the frame can be re-shown), it can produce
                     a race condition in the underlying java.awt.Toolkit implementation.  As a workaround,
                     callers of DialogDisplayer.getDefault().notify(DialogDescriptor) may set the system
                     property "javahelp.ignore.modality" to the String "true".  This system property will
                     be reset by notify(), and applied as a client property of the root pane of the dialog
                     to be shown.  JavaHelp will, in turn, ignore the appearance of any dialog whose root
                     pane posesses the client property "javahelp.ignore.modality" with the String value
                     "true".

<b>Answer:</b>
        Yes, it registers a global AWT window listener. This appears to be the
        only way to reliably tell whether a modal dialog is showing at a given
        time (and to receive notification when one is shown). There is a rather
        complex set of hacks to convert the help viewer into a nonmodal dialog
        and reparent it to an active modal dialog; otherwise it would be
        impossible to access help while a modal dialog was showing. There is an
        open request for AWT to support multiple application contexts, which
        would permit the help viewer to live in an independent context and not be
        blocked by modal dialogs used in NetBeans, but until this is fixed there
        is no known good solution to the modality problem.

<b>Answer:</b>
        Size of help set XML files (the map file especially) probably impacts
        parsing speed and memory consumption. Number of distinct help sets will
        probably impact performance as well. Exact numbers unknown, but JavaHelp

<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
        When displaying help, all help sets need to be parsed by JavaHelp to
        determine the ID maps. For a large number of help sets, this might
        consume too much memory and CPU to be practical. Also when displaying
        "merged" help (the normal case), all help sets need to be merged
        together, which can also be time-consuming as their number grows.

<b>Answer:</b>
        Menu items representing links to help topics are dynamically enabled or

        parsed, to avoid forcing a parse just to display the menu item; if
        selected at this time when there is no actual corresponding ID, they will
        do nothing. After help sets have been parsed, menu items referring to
        help topics which are actually available (the normal case) are enabled.
        In case a help topic is missing for some reason, the menu item is
        disabled.

            Does your code create its own class loader(s)?
            <hint>
            A bit unusual. Please explain why and what for.
            </hint>
        </question>

<!--
        <question id="exec-component">
            Is execution of your code influenced by any (string) property
            of any of your components?
            
            <hint>
            Often <code>JComponent.getClientProperty</code>, <code>Action.getValue</code>
            or <code>PropertyDescriptor.getValue</code>, etc. are used to influence
            a behaviour of some code. This of course forms an interface that should
            be documented. Also if one depends on some interface that an object
            implements (<code>component instanceof Runnable</code>) that forms an
            API as well.

<!--
        <question id="exec-introspection">
            Does your module use any kind of runtime type informations (instanceof,
            work with java.lang.Class, etc.)?
            <hint>
            Check for cases when you have an object of type A and you also
            expect it to (possibly) be of type B and do some special action. That
            should be documented. The same applies on operations in meta-level
            (Class.isInstance(...), Class.isAssignableFrom(...), etc.).

        <question id="exec-privateaccess">
            Are you aware of any other parts of the system calling some of 
            your methods by reflection?
            <hint>
            If so, describe the &quot;contract&quot; as an API. Likely private or friend one, but
            still API and consider rewrite of it.
            </hint>
        </question>

<!--
        <question id="exec-process">
            Do you execute an external process from your module? How do you ensure
            that the result is the same on different platforms? Do you parse output?
            Do you depend on result code?
            <hint>
            If you feed an input, parse the output please declare that as an API.

<!--
        <question id="exec-property">
            Is execution of your code influenced by any environment or
            Java system (<code>System.getProperty</code>) property?
            
            <hint>
            If there is a property that can change the behaviour of your 
            code, somebody will likely use it. You should describe what it does 
            and the stability category of this API. You may use
            <pre>
                &lt;property name=&quot;id&quot; category=&quot;private&quot; >
                    description of the property, where it is used, what it influence, etc.

            Does your code use Java Reflection to execute other code?
            <hint>
            This usually indicates a missing or unsufficient API in the other
            part of the system. If the other side is not aware of your dependency
            this contract can be easily broken.
            </hint>

            Which data flavors (if any) does your code read from or insert to

            <hint>
            Often Node's deal with clipboard by usage of <code>Node.clipboardCopy, Node.clipboardCut and Node.pasteTypes</code>.
            Check your code for overriding these methods.

            Often Node's deal with clipboard by usage of <code>Node.drag, Node.getDropType</code>. 
            Check your code for overriding these methods. Btw. if they are not overriden, they
            by default delegate to <code>Node.clipboardCopy, Node.clipboardCut and Node.pasteTypes</code>.

<!--
        <question id="lookup-lookup">
            Does your module use <code>org.openide.util.Lookup</code>

            <hint>
            Please describe the interfaces you are searching for, where 
            are defined, whether you are searching for just one or more of them,
            if the order is important, etc. Also clasify the stability of such

            Do you register anything into lookup for other code to find?

            Why? Of course, that is possible, but it can be dangerous. Is the module
            your are masking resource from aware of what you are doing?

            Does your module execute any long-running tasks?
            <hint>Typically they are tasks like connecting over
            network, computing huge amount of data, compilation.
            Such communication should be done asynchronously (for example
            using <code>RequestProcessor</code>), definitively it should 
            not block AWT thread.

            Does your module use <code>java.io.File</code> directly?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the prefered
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when
            this is not suitable.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
    



<!--
        <question id="resources-layer">
            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create any files or
            folders in it? What it is trying to communicate by that and with which 
            components?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.).

            their layers?
            
            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.
            </hint>
        </question>

<!--
        <question id="resources-read">
            Does your module read any resources from layers? For what purpose?
            
            <hint>
            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.
            Please describe it and clasify according to 
            <a href="http://openide.netbeans.org/tutorial/api-design.html#categories">
            common stability categories</a>.

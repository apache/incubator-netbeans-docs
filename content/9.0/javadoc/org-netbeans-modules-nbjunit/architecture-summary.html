<li>"<b>z-a</b>" - sort the tests in descending alphabetical order</li>
                
<li>"<b>shuffle</b>" - randomize the order of the tests. 
                    If a test fails in this mode a <em>seed</em> is attached to

<b>Answer:</b>
  
<p>
NetBeans extension to JUnit uses standard JUnit preferences file to store additional information required when using advanced features of NbJUnit. The junit.properties file is a standard property file, which is stored in user's home directory (as defined in user.home system property of JVM). Recognized properties by NbJUnit are the following: 
nbjunit.diff.impl - name of the java class implementing org.netbeans.junit.diff.Diff inteface. This class performs 'diff' between files. In NBJunit extension is available org.netbeans.junit.diff.SimpleDiff for simple comparision (this class decides only whether compared files are equal or not, it does not provide any additional information) and org.netbeans.junit.diff.NativeDiff for comparision via native diff code (e.g. diff program on unix machines).
Please note, SimpleDiff is rather trivial implementation of diff command, so it is recommended to use native diff whenever possible.
  </p>

  
<ul>

      
<li>
        
<a href="#systemproperty-nbjunit.diff.impl.CmdLine">nbjunit.diff.impl.CmdLine</a>
            - 
            used only when nbjunit.diff.impl is set
            to org.netbeans.junit.diff.NativeDiff class. This property
            contain command line, which is called from NativeDiff class
            to perform comparision. This property use
            also '%TESTFILE%' and '%PASSFILE%' variables understood
            by NbJUnit, which are replaced with real
            file names when running tests.

            Order of elements</a> for description of the problem). The acceptable
            values of the property are:
            <ul>
                
<li>"<b>natural</b>" - use the methods as provided by JDK (e.g. quite random on JDK7)</li>
                
<li>"<b>a-z</b>" - sort the tests in ascending alphabetical order</li>
                
<li>"<b>z-a</b>" - sort the tests in descending alphabetical order</li>
                
<li>"<b>shuffle</b>" - randomize the order of the tests. 
                    If a test fails in this mode a <em>seed</em> is attached to
                    the failure message, use it in the seed mode
                </li>
                
<li>seed mode "<b>12234390434</b>" - one can specify any long value
                    as a <em>seed</em> to shuffle the methods. Use this to reproduce
                    random failures
                </li>
            
</ul>
            The default order is <b>natural</b> right now, but this may

            If you provide an ant task that users can use, you need to be very

                data against concurrent access, race conditions, deadlocks, etc.,
                and whether such rules are enforced by runtime warnings, errors, assertions, etc.
                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might
                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex
                (and may or may not automatically acquire that mutex on behalf of a client method);

                impact on performance. In some cases it may be more appropriate to make a simple action that is

Please increment the 'version' field of <api-questions> whenever you make a
semantic change: adding a new question or significantly changing the meaning of
an old one. Changing this field ensures that arch pages answering the old version
print a warning during Javadoc generation. If you only change hints or make small

<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
  
<p>
   Provides the basic infrastructure by which Ant-based projects can be created,
   read and write configuration parameters and properties from/to disk, satisfy
   common queries and interfaces, etc. See Javadoc and build system design
   document.

            to use the module?
        </em></font>
<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
  
<p>
   Mostly an SPI for use by project type providers to create the project type.
   Also includes a small API/SPI for other projects to find what Ant build steps
   are necessary to create a certain build product, for use in inter-project
   dependencies.

<b>Ant project support faq:</b>
    
  
<h4>How to use support for storing project properties?</h4>
  
    
<em><b>Q:</b>
    I'm creating a customizer (properties dialog) for my project type. I wan't to use the support
    for simple data types. What do I need to do?</em>
    
<p>
    You basicaly need to do two things. First create the representation of the project properties which
    can be used in the GUI. Second at some time convert the objects back to the ANT properties form and
    store them into the project.
    </p>
    
<ul>
        
<li>
<b>Creating the object representation.</b>
            
<ol>
                
<li>Create new instance of StoreGroup for each group of properties you want to store later
                    e.g. project and prvate. Sometimes it might be useful to create temporary source group
                    which will only be used for creating the models without being used for storing. E.g.
                    for properties which need special handling.</li>
                
<li>Call the factory methods e.g. createBooleanButtonModel, createStringDocument, etc. which
                    will create the swing models for you.</li>
                
<li>Use the models in your Swing controls by calling setModel() or setDocument()</li>
            
</ol>                                 
        
</li>
        
<li>
<b>Storing the models back to the proprties of project.</b>
            
<ol>
                
<li>Get the EditableProperties you want to store the model in e.g. private or project 
                    properties</li>
                
<li>Call the store method on given SourceGroup with the EditableProperties as parameter</li>
                
<li>Manually store models which need some special handling.</li>

   A check for buggy Xalan is performed during startup. The test tries to lookup

   not on the classpath. If the class can be resolved, other checks (not using

            Does your code use Java Reflection to execute other code?
            <hint>
            This usually indicates a missing or insufficient API in the other
            part of the system. If the other side is not aware of your dependency
            this contract can be easily broken.

        <question id="exec-threading" when="impl">
            What threading models, if any, does your module adhere to?
            <hint>
                If your module calls foreign APIs which have a specific threading model,
                indicate how you comply with the requirements for multithreaded access
                (synchronization, mutexes, etc.) applicable to those APIs.
                If your module defines any APIs, or has complex internal structures
                that might be used from multiple threads, declare how you protect
                data against concurrent access, race conditions, deadlocks, etc.,
                and whether such rules are enforced by runtime warnings, errors, assertions, etc.
                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might
                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex
                (and may or may not automatically acquire that mutex on behalf of a client method);
                might be able to run only in the event queue; etc.
                Also describe when any events are fired: synchronously, asynchronously, etc.

            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the preferred
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when
            this is not suitable.

<!--
        <question id="resources-layer" when="final">

            components?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of

            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.

            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.

            permissions to loaded code unless realy necessary.
            Also note that your API implementation
            can also expose unneeded permissions to enemy code by

            <hint>
            If you provide an ant task that users can use, you need to be very
            careful about its syntax and behaviour, as it most likely forms an
	          API for end users and as there is a lot of end users, their reaction
            when such API gets broken can be pretty strong.

                Due to XML ID restrictions, rather than /org/netbeans/modules/foo give the "name" as org.netbeans.modules.foo.

        Navigator listen to system activated node changes and sets activated
        node for Navigator top component accordingly. Local activated node is
        set from system activated node if any provider agrees to display content
        for data object behind the node. Navigator relies on default lookup
        mechanism of TopComponent to populate its activated node.
        Currently it means that if node backed by JavaDataObject is activated node
        in the system, it is also activated node for Navigator's top component.
        So main menu actions like Compile File, Move Class etc. work as usual
        when Navigator window is active.
        Also, lookup of currently selected Node is searched for NavigatorPanel
        SPI instances.

<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
   Navigator module is a base API module which provides:
   
   <ul>
    
<li> A place for modules to show structure/outline of their documents</li>
    
<li> Ability for modules to show their view only when special document(node)
     is active in the system</li>
    
<li> UI for switching between multiple views available for currently active document(node)</li>
    
<li> Coalescing of fast coming selected node changes to show content for</li>
    
</ul>

<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
  
<p>
   Navigator API is good for clients (module writers) that want to show some
   structure or outline of their document in dedicated window, allowing end user
   fast navigation and control over the document.</p>
   
<p>
   API allows its clients to plug in their Swing based views easily, which 
   then will be automatically shown in specialized Navigator UI.</p>

        </em></font>
<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
    
   
<h4>Basic Usage Steps</h4>
      In order to plug in a view into Navigator UI for certain document (data) type,
      module writers need to write a <a href="org/netbeans/spi/navigator/NavigatorPanel.html" shape="rect">NavigatorPanel</a>
      implementation marked with <code>@Registration</code>.

      <h4>Writing NavigatorPanel implementation</h4>
        
<p>Implementing <a href="org/netbeans/spi/navigator/NavigatorPanel.html" shape="rect">NavigatorPanel</a>
         interface is easy, you can copy from template basic implementation 
        <a href="org/netbeans/spi/navigator/doc-files/BasicNavPanelImpl_java" shape="rect">BasicNavPanelImpl.java</a>.</p>
        
        Advices on important part of panel implementation:

        <ul>
            
<li>
<b>Instantiation:</b> Your implementation of NavigatorPanel
            is instantied automatically by the system if you register it using <code>@Registration</code>.</li>

            
<li>
<b>getComponent</b> method: Simply create and return your UI
            representation of your data in Swing's JComponent envelope. Just be sure
            that you don't create new JComponent subclass per every call, as
            performance will suffer then.<p></p>
</li>

            
<li>
<b>panelActivated and panelDeactivated</b> methods wraps an 
            'active' life of your panel implementation. In panelActivated, grab
            your data from given <a href="../org-openide-util-lookup/org/openide/util/Lookup.html" shape="rect">Lookup</a>,
            usually by looking up its asociated
            <a href="../org-openide-loaders/org/openide/loaders/DataObject.html" shape="rect">DataObject</a>
            or 
            <a href="../org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/FileObject.html" shape="rect">FileObject</a>
            to take data from. Also remember to attach listeners to lookup result,
            perhaps also to data itself and trigger UI update with new data.
            Code will typically look like this:<br>
            
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        /** JavaDataObject used as example, replace with your own data source */
        private static final Lookup.Template MY_DATA = new Lookup.Template(JavaDataObject.class);

        public void panelActivated (Lookup context) {
            // lookup context and listen to result to get notified about context changes
            curResult = context.lookup(MY_DATA);
            curResult.addLookupListener(/** your LookupListener impl here*/);
            Collection data = curResult.allInstances();
            // ... compute view from data and trigger repaint
        }
            </pre>
            Do *not* perform any long computation in panelActivated directly, see below.<br>
            In panelDeactivated, be sure to remove all listeners to context given
            to you in panelActivated.<p></p>
</li>

            
<li>
<b>Long computation of content:</b> What if rendering your
            Navigator view takes long time, more than several milliseconds?
            Right approach is to create and run new task using
            <a href="../org-openide-util/org/openide/util/RequestProcessor.html" shape="rect">RequestProcessor techniques</a>, 
            each time when panelActivated call arrived or your listeners on 
            data context got called.<br>
            While computing, UI of Navigator view
            should show some please wait message.<p></p>
</li>
        
</ul>

      
<h4>Registering NavigatorPanel impl</h4>
       
<p>Declarative registration of your NavigatorPanel impl connects this
        implementation with specific content type, which is type of 
        the document, expressed in mime-type syntax, for example 'text/x-java'
        for java sources. Infrastructure will automatically load and show
        your NavigatorPanel impl in UI, when <b>currently activated Node
        is backed by primary FileObject whose 
        <a href="../org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/FileObject.html#getMIMEType--" shape="rect">FileObject.getMimeType()</a>
        equals to content type specified in your registering annotation</b> (see more options below).</p>
    

   
<h4>Advanced Content Registration - Linking to Node's Lookup</h4>
        
<p>There may be situations where linking between your Navigator view and
        activated Node's primary FileObject is not enough or not possible at all.
        This simply happens when the data you want to represent in Navigator are
        not accessible through primary FileObject or DataObject. Usual example is
        Multiview environment, where more views of one document exists.</p>
         
        
<p>The solution is to bind content of your Navigator view directly to your
        TopComponent. Then, whenever your TopComponent gets activated in the system, Navigator UI
        will show th content you connected to it.</p>
        
        
<b>Steps to do:</b>
         
        
<ul>
            
<li>Choose your content type, could be either well known or arbitrary,
            say <b>'text/my-amazing-type'</b> and
            do all basic steps described in above use case.<p></p>
</li>
            
            
<li>Implement <a href="org/netbeans/spi/navigator/NavigatorLookupHint.html" shape="rect">NavigatorLookupHint</a>
             interface like this:
             <pre xml:space="preserve">
        class AmazingTypeLookupHint implements NavigatorLookupHint {
            public String getContentType () {
                return "text/my-amazing-type";
            }
        }
             </pre>
             
<p></p>
</li>
             
            
<li>Alter your <a href="../org-openide-windows/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.html" shape="rect">TopComponent</a>
             to contain your NavigatorLookupHint implementation (AmazingTypeLookupHint in this case)
            in its lookup, returned from 
            <a href="../org-openide-windows/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.html#getLookup--" shape="rect">TopComponent.getLookup()</a>
             method.<p></p>
</li>
             
             
<li>
             Another option you have is to alter lookup of your <code>Node</code> subclass 
             instead of directly altering lookup of your <code>TopComponent</code>.
             See <a href="../org-openide-nodes/org/openide/nodes/Node.html#getLookup--" shape="rect">Node.getLookup()</a> method.
             Then Navigator will show your desired content whenever your <code>Node</code>
             subclass will be active in the system.<br>             
             However, keep in mind that this option is less preferred, because it
             only uses implementation detail knowledge that default implementation
             of <code>TopComponent.getLookup()</code> includes also results from 
             lookup of asociated <code>Node</code>. So this approach will stop
             working if you change default behaviour of <code>TopComponent.getLookup()</code> method.
             <p></p>
             
</li>
             
        
</ul>
   
           
   
   
   
<h4>Programmatic activation of NavigatorPanel</h4>
        
<p>Programmatic activation of specific navigator panel activates and shows
            navigator panel in navigation area, as if user had selected the panel
            manually. API clients are expected to use programmatic activation to
            activate/select preferred panel from a set of available panels.</p>
        
<b>Example:</b>
            Several <code>TopComponents</code> in multiview arrangement,
            <code>TopComponentA</code> and <code>TopComponentB</code>.
            Both components provide the same
            <code>NavigatorLookupHint</code> impl, which is recognized by two
            providers <code>NavigatorPanelA</code> and <code>NavigatorPanelB</code>.
            Now when <code>TopComponentA</code> becomes activated (has a focus),
            it's desirable to select/show <code>NavigatorPanelA</code> from
            navigator panels. On the other side, when <code>TopComponentB</code>
            is activated, <code>NavigatorPanelB</code> should be activated automatically.
            <p></p>
         
        
<b>Steps to do to activate panel programmatically:</b>
         
        
<ul>

<h4>Setting activated node of Navigator window</h4>
        
<p>Sometimes clients need to alter activated Nodes of Navigator window,
            to better represent Navigator area content within the whole application.
            See <a href="../org-openide-windows/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.html#getActivatedNodes--" shape="rect">TopComponent.getActivatedNodes()</a>
            and <a href="../org-openide-windows/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.Registry.html#getActivatedNodes--" shape="rect">TopComponent.Registry.html#getActivatedNodes()</a>
            to find out what activated nodes of TopComponent and whole system mean.
        </p>
        
<b>Use Case Example:</b>
            NavigatorPanel implementation shows list or tree of some <code>Node</code>s
            in Navigator area. When user selects a Node in the list or tree,
            it is desirable to show selected Node's properties in Properties
            window and enable proper actions in main menu. Exactly this can be done
            by presenting Node selected in the list/tree as activated Node of 
            Navigator window.
            <p></p>
         
        
<b>Steps to specify activated Nodes of Navigator window:</b>
         
        
<ul>
            
<li>In your implementation of <code>NavigatorPanel</code>, implement
                method <code>getLookup()</code> to return Lookup instance filled
                with Node(s) that you want to set as activated Nodes of Navigator window.
                <p></p>
            
</li>
            
            
<li>Be sure to update Lookup content properly, for example using
                <a href="../org-openide-util-lookup/org/openide/util/lookup/InstanceContent.html" shape="rect">InstanceContent</a> as follows:
             <pre xml:space="preserve">
        class MyNavigatorPanel implements NavigatorPanel {
        
            /** Dynamic Lookup content */
            private final InstanceContent ic;
            /** Lookup instance */
            private final Lookup lookup;
            
            public MyNavigatorPanel () {
                this.ic = new InstanceContent();
                this.lookup = new AbstractLookup(ic);
            }
        
            public Lookup getLookup () {
                return lookup;
            }

            /** Call this method when activated Nodes change is needed, 
            * for example when selection changes in your NavigatorPanel's Component
            */
            private void selectionChanged (Node oldSel, Node newSel) {
                ic.remove(oldSel);
                ic.add(newSel);
            }
            
            ... impl of rest of your NavigatorPanel
            
        }
             </pre>
            
</li>
             
        
</ul>
           
   

   
<h4>Adding UndoRedo support to the navigation view</h4>
        
<p>Some complex navigation views need support for undoing and redoing 
            edit changes done either directly in the view or in document which 
            the view is representing.
        </p>
         
        
<b>Steps to support undo and redo in navigation view:</b>
         
        
<ul>
            
<li>Implement your navigation view as <a href="org/netbeans/spi/navigator/NavigatorPanelWithUndo.html" shape="rect">NavigatorPanelWithUndo</a>,
                which is <code>NavigatorPanel</code> interface with extra method 
                <a href="org/netbeans/spi/navigator/NavigatorPanelWithUndo.html#getUndoRedo--" shape="rect">getUndoRedo()</a>.
                <p></p>
            
</li>
            
            
<li>All other things remain the same as with basic <code>NavigatorPanel</code> usage.
                <code>UndoRedo</code> support returned from <code>NavigatorPanelWithUndo.getUndoRedo()</code>
                is propagated to the Navigator TopComponent and returned as its
                <code>UndoRedo</code> support. For details see 
                <a href="../org-openide-windows/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.html#getUndoRedo--" shape="rect">TopComponent.getUndoRedo()</a>
                and <a href="../org-openide-awt/org/openide/awt/UndoRedo.html" shape="rect">UndoRedo interface</a>.
                <p></p>
            
</li>

            
<li>Example of <code>NavigatorPanelWithUndo</code> implementation:
             <pre xml:space="preserve">
        class MyNavigatorPanelWithUndo implements NavigatorPanelWithUndo {
        
            /** UndoRedo support, substitute with your impl */
            private final UndoRedo undo = new UndoRedo.Manager();
        
            public UndoRedo getUndoRedo () {
                return undo;
            }
            
            ... rest of the NavigatorPanelWithUndo impl ...

        }
             </pre>
            
</li>
             
        
</ul>
           
   

   
<h4>Removing active Node/DataObject related NavigatorPanels from Navigator window</h4>
        
<p>In certain situations it's not desired to show NavigatorPanel implementations
            related to DataObject of active Node in Navigator window. Typically
            you need to have active Node of some type, so that actions in the system
            works properly. But you don't want to show NavigatorPanels that "come"
            with such active Node. 
        </p>

        
<b>Steps to remove such NavigatorPanels:</b>

        
<ul>
         
<li>Implement interface <a href="org/netbeans/spi/navigator/NavigatorLookupPanelsPolicy.html" shape="rect">NavigatorLookupPanelsPolicy</a>,
             return kind of policy that suits you from <code>getPanelsPolicy()</code> method.
             <p></p>
        
</li>
         
<li>Put implementation instance into your TopComponent's subclass lookup,
             see <a href="../org-openide-windows/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.html#getLookup--" shape="rect">TopComponent.getLookup()</a>
             for details.
             <p></p>
         
</li>
         
<li>Now when your TopComponent becomes active in the system, found
             panels policy is used to limit/affect set of available
             <a href="org/netbeans/spi/navigator/NavigatorPanel.html" shape="rect">NavigatorPanel</a>
             implementations. 
             <p></p>
         
</li>
        
</ul>

   
   
   
<h4>Integration of Explorer view into Navigator</h4>
        
<p>Explorer views comes handy when showing Nodes in varienty of situations
            and it is just natural to be able to integrate them into Navigator window.
            Working with explorer views is described at 
            <a href="../org-openide-explorer/org/openide/explorer/ExplorerUtils.html" shape="rect">ExplorerUtils javadoc</a>.
            Integration with Navigator is easy and there are only subtle differencies
            from integration into TopComponent.
        </p>
        
        
<b>Steps to integrate some kind of Explorer View into Navigator:</b>
         
        
<ul>
            
<li>Implement <code>NavigatorPanel</code> interface and return created explorer
                view from <code>getComponent()</code> method. Creating explorer view
                is described in <a href="../org-openide-explorer/org/openide/explorer/ExplorerUtils.html" shape="rect">ExplorerUtils</a>.
                <p></p>
            
</li>
            
            
<li>Return lookup created using 
                <a href="../org-openide-explorer/org/openide/explorer/ExplorerUtils.html#createLookup-org.openide.explorer.ExplorerManager-javax.swing.ActionMap-" shape="rect">
                ExplorerUtils.createLookup(ExplorerManager, ActionMap)</a> 
                from <code>getLookup()</code> method of <code>NavigatorPanel</code>.
                <p></p>
            
</li>
            
            
<li>Use <a href="../org-openide-explorer/org/openide/explorer/ExplorerUtils.html#activateActions-org.openide.explorer.ExplorerManager-boolean-" shape="rect">
                ExplorerUtils.activateActions(ExplorerManager, boolean)</a> for actions activation and

<b>Answer:</b>
  
<p>
    (June 8, 2005) Basic design and implementation are somehow written and
    compilable, but not tested so far.
    Estimated time for work left is three-four weeks of one-man work.

<b>Answer:</b>
  
<p>
   Unit tests will be written ensuring that implementation loads, instantiates
   and calls client's SPI correctly. Usual manual testing will be performed as
   well. As whole API is rather small, it will be easily covered by unit tests
   as a whole.

<b>Answer:</b>
 
<p>
    
<a href="#lookup-activated_node">activated_node</a>
            - 
     <p>
        Navigator listen to system activated node changes and sets activated
        node for Navigator top component accordingly. Local activated node is
        set from system activated node if any provider agrees to display content
        for data object behind the node. Navigator relies on default lookup
        mechanism of TopComponent to populate its activated node.
        Currently it means that if node backed by JavaDataObject is activated node
        in the system, it is also activated node for Navigator's top component.
        So main menu actions like Compile File, Move Class etc. work as usual
        when Navigator window is active.
        Also, lookup of currently selected Node is searched for NavigatorPanel
        SPI instances.

            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number

            <hint>
            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to
            public classes of your module from other modules. This prevents
            unwanted dependencies of others on your code and should be used
            whenever possible (<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/download/javadoc/OpenAPIs/org/openide/doc-files/upgrade.html#3.4-public-packages">
            public packages
            </a>). If you do not restrict access to your classes you are
            making it too easy for other people to misuse your implementation
            details, that is why you should have good reason for not 
            restricting package access.

            Often <code>JComponent.getClientProperty</code>, <code>Action.getValue</code>
            or <code>PropertyDescriptor.getValue</code>, etc. are used to influence
            a behavior of some code. This of course forms an interface that should
            be documented. Also if one depends on some interface that an object
            implements (<code>component instanceof Runnable</code>) that forms an

            <hint>
            Check for cases when you have an object of type A and you also
            expect it to (possibly) be of type B and do some special action. That
            should be documented. The same applies on operations in meta-level

            <hint>
            If there is a property that can change the behavior of your 
            code, somebody will likely use it. You should describe what it does 
            and the <a href="http://openide.netbeans.org/tutorial/api-design.html#life">stability category</a>

            This usually indicates a missing or insufficient API in the other
            part of the system. If the other side is not aware of your dependency
            this contract can be easily broken.

        <question id="exec-threading" when="impl">
            What threading models, if any, does your module adhere to?
            <hint>
                If your module calls foreign APIs which have a specific threading model,
                indicate how you comply with the requirements for multithreaded access
                (synchronization, mutexes, etc.) applicable to those APIs.
                If your module defines any APIs, or has complex internal structures
                that might be used from multiple threads, declare how you protect
                data against concurrent access, race conditions, deadlocks, etc.,
                and whether such rules are enforced by runtime warnings, errors, assertions, etc.
                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might
                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex
                (and may or may not automatically acquire that mutex on behalf of a client method);
                might be able to run only in the event queue; etc.
                Also describe when any events are fired: synchronously, asynchronously, etc.

            Does your module use <code>java.io.File</code> directly?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the preferred
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when
            this is not suitable.
            </hint>

<!--
        <question id="resources-layer" when="final">
            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create any files or
            folders in it? What it is trying to communicate by that and with which 
            components?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.). 
            </hint>
        </question>

<!--
        <question id="resources-mask" when="final">
            Does your module mask/hide/override any resources provided by other modules in
            their layers?
            
            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.
            </hint>

<!--
        <question id="resources-read" when="final">
            Does your module read any resources from layers? For what purpose?
            
            <hint>
            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.
            Please describe it and classify according to 
            <a href="http://openide.netbeans.org/tutorial/api-design.html#categories">
            common stability categories</a>.

<!--
        <question id="security-grant" when="final">
            Does your code grant additional rights to some other code?
            <hint>Avoid using a class loader that adds extra
            permissions to loaded code unless really necessary.
            Also note that your API implementation
            can also expose unneeded permissions to enemy code by
            calling AccessController.doPrivileged().</hint>
        </question>

<!--
        <question id="security-policy" when="final">
            Does your functionality require modifications to the standard policy file?
            <hint>Your code might pass control to third-party code not
            coming from trusted domains. This could be code downloaded over the
            network or code coming from libraries that are not bundled
            with NetBeans. Which permissions need to be granted to which domains?</hint>
        </question>

 <!--
        <question id="exec-ant-tasks" when="impl">
            Do you define or register any ant tasks that other can use?
            
            <hint>
            If you provide an ant task that users can use, you need to be very
            careful about its syntax and behaviour, as it most likely forms an
	          API for end users and as there is a lot of end users, their reaction
            when such API gets broken can be pretty strong.
            </hint>

<!--
        <question id="arch-where" when="init">
            Where one can find sources for your module?

                Please provide link to the CVS web client at
                http://www.netbeans.org/download/source_browse.html
                or just use tag defaultanswer generate='here'

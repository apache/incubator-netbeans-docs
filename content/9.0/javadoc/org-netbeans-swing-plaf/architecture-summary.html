            The module initializes proper Look&amp;Feel. The decision is done
            based on various inputs including what has been specified on command
            line. To allow easier branding for those who build applications
            on top of NetBeans, there is key <code>LookAndFeelClassName</code>
            in <code>org.netbeans.swing.plaf.Bundle</code>
            bundle which can be branded to actual name of the L&amp;F class.
            The module will decide which sets of customizations to load based on
            the chosen look and feel.

            The module adds some UIManager keys and values to provide e.g. special
            border for main window toolbar or UI classes for tab control headers.
            By default the proper subclass of LFCustoms is derived from current
            Look and Feel name. Applications building on top of NetBeans can provide
            their own look and feel customizations by branding <code>LookAndFeelCustomsClassName</code>
            key in <code>org.netbeans.swing.plaf.Bundle</code>
            bundle.

<h2>General Information</h2>
<ul>
<p></p>
<font color="gray"><b><a name="answer-arch-what">Question (arch-what)</a>:</b><em>
            What is this project good for?
            
        </em></font>
<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
	The plaf library consists primarily of code that used to be in core.  What it does:
        <ul>
	
<li>Installs a custom look and feel if a custom look and feel class is passed to it</li>
        
<li>Sets the correct fonts in the Swing UIDefaults if a custom fontsize is desired for the application's UI</li>
        
<li>Loads a UI theme if a URL for the theme file (no format changes since NetBeans 3.4) is passed to it</li>
        
<li>Installs custom UI keys and values used by other components of NetBeans, such as colors and UI delegate class names used by
   	    other parts NetBeans.  Examples of these:
             <ul>
               
<li>Tab control UI delegate class name, depending on the look and feel, for the window system</li>
               
<li>Definitions of colors which the tab control, property sheet and output window will use, if present in
                   UIDefaults, to color themselves in accordance with the UI spec for them on a given look and feel</li>
               
<li>Custom border implementations NetBeans uses for scroll panes to reduce "border-buildup"</li>
               
<li>A custom implementation of ToolbarUI which NetBeans uses for its toolbars, and a custom UI for 
                   toolbar buttons which sizes them correctly (GTK and Aqua only, currently)</li>
               
<li>Insets definition for the editor scrollbar, used to get the height of the upper and lower button of the scrollbar
                   for purposes of the Error Stripe. The appropriate key value is "Nb.Editor.ErrorStripe.ScrollBar.Insets".
               </li>
             
</ul>
         
</li>
         
<li>Compensate for missing elements on some (GTK) look and feels, which standard Swing code expects to be
             present, i.e. UIManager.getColor ("control"), to enable older code to run unmodified on newer
             look and feels.</li>
         
</ul>
    

    Its API consists of a single method, org.netbeans.swing.plaf.Startup.run (Class lookAndFeel, int fontSize, URL themeFile),
    which should be called early in NetBeans startup sequence by core, to initialize UIDefaults values before any main window
    GUI is constructed.  It provides a minimal SPI in the form of the abstract class LFCustoms, which an alternate look and
    feel could use to provide lists of keys and values which should be installed into UIDefaults, via the mechanism documented
    in the documentation for LFCustoms.

<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
Some unit tests may be provided in the future; the per-look-and-feel classes are simply
a mechanism to provide mainly a list of strings to put into UIDefaults - they could (and may be
eventually) be replaced by XML theme files.

            Do you need to be installed in the shared location only, or in the user directory only,
            or can your module be installed anywhere?
            
        </em></font>
<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
        It is a library, not a module, because its code must run very early in the startup sequence,
        before other GUI is constructed, so that all GUIs will have the correct colors, borders, UI
        delegates, etc.  All of this was formerly done directly in core.
    <p></p>
<font color="gray"><b><a name="answer-deploy-packages">Question (deploy-packages)</a>:</b><em>
            Are packages of your module made inaccessible by not declaring them
            public?
            
            
        </em></font>
<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
        No.  There is one root package containing the API, and several per-look-and-feel packages
        containing implementations of standard Swing UI delegates (such as a custom toolbar UI for
        Aqua and GTK look and feels), and custom implementations of Border and such.  Swing's mechanism
        for loading a UI delegate is by fetching the UI class name from UIDefaults and creating an 
        instance of that class, so the UI delegates must be publicly accessible for Swing to be able
        to load them.
    <p></p>
<font color="gray"><b><a name="answer-deploy-dependencies">Question (deploy-dependencies)</a>:</b><em>
            What do other modules need to do to declare a dependency on this one,
            in addition to or instead of the normal module dependency declaration
            (e.g. tokens to require)?
            
        </em></font>
<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
Components such as the window system, which use values defined here, will behave in a reasonable
way if those values are not defined.  However, it is preferable that they declare a runtime
dependency on the plaf library.

            - 
            The module initializes proper Look&amp;Feel. The decision is done
            based on various inputs including what has been specified on command
            line. To allow easier branding for those who build applications
            on top of NetBeans, there is key <code>LookAndFeelClassName</code>
            in <code>org.netbeans.swing.plaf.Bundle</code>
            bundle which can be branded to actual name of the L&amp;F class.
            The module will decide which sets of customizations to load based on
            the chosen look and feel.
        

        <a href="#property-LookAndFeelCustomsClassName">LookAndFeelCustomsClassName</a>
            - 
            The module adds some UIManager keys and values to provide e.g. special

            By default the proper subclass of LFCustoms is derived from current
            Look and Feel name. Applications building on top of NetBeans can provide
            their own look and feel customizations by branding <code>LookAndFeelCustomsClassName</code>
            key in <code>org.netbeans.swing.plaf.Bundle</code>
            bundle.

<b>Answer:</b>
        For testing purposes only, the system property "nb.forceui" can be used to
        load NetBeans customizations for a different look and feel (such as loading the custom
        Aqua UI delegates on Windows).  The only purpose for this flag is to enable 
        development/bug fixing and minimal testing when a developer is working on a machine
        that does not support the requested look and feel, and they want to be sure they
        have not broken anything.

        <question id="perf-mem">
            How much memory does your component consume? Estimate
            with a relation to the number of windows, etc.
        </question>
-->
    



<!--
        <question id="perf-menus">
            Does your module use dynamically updated context menus, or
            context-sensitive actions with complicated enablement logic?
        </question>
-->
    



<!--
        <question id="perf-progress">
            Does your module execute any long-running tasks?
            <hint>Typically they are tasks like connecting over
            network, computing huge amount of data, compilation.
            Such communication should be done asynchronously (for example
            using <code>RequestProcessor</code>), definitively it should 
            not block AWT thread.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
    



<!--
        <question id="perf-scale">
            Which external criteria influence the performance of your
            program (size of file in editor, number of files in menu, 
            in source directory, etc.) and how well your code scales?
            Please include some estimates.
        </question>
-->
    



<!--
        <question id="perf-startup">
            Does your module run any code on startup?
        </question>
-->
    



<!--
        <question id="perf-wakeup">
            Does any piece of your code wake up periodically and do something
            even when the system is otherwise idle (no user interaction)?
        </question>
-->
    



<!--
        <question id="resources-file">
            Does your module use <code>java.io.File</code> directly?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the prefered
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when
            this is not suitable.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
    



<!--
        <question id="resources-layer">
            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create any files or
            folders in it? What it is trying to communicate by that and with which 
            components?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.). 
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
    



<!--
        <question id="resources-mask">
            Does your module mask/hide/override any resources provided by other modules in
            their layers?
            
            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
    



<!--
        <question id="resources-read">
            Does your module read any resources from layers? For what purpose?
            
            <hint>
            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.
            Please describe it and clasify according to 
            <a href="http://openide.netbeans.org/tutorial/api-design.html#categories">
            common stability categories</a>.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
    

<!--
        <question id="exec-introspection">
            Does your module use any kind of runtime type information (<code>instanceof</code>,
            work with <code>java.lang.Class</code>, etc.)?
            <hint>
            Check for cases when you have an object of type A and you also
            expect it to (possibly) be of type B and do some special action. That
            should be documented. The same applies on operations in meta-level
            (Class.isInstance(...), Class.isAssignableFrom(...), etc.).
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
    



<!--
        <question id="exec-process">
            Do you execute an external process from your module? How do you ensure
            that the result is the same on different platforms? Do you parse output?
            Do you depend on result code?
            <hint>
            If you feed an input, parse the output please declare that as an API.
            </hint>
        </question>

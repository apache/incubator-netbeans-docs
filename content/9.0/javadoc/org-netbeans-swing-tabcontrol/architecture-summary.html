          API contains classes used only by <em>switchers</em> accessible through main menu in "Window/Documents..."
          and "Go To/Recent Document". Besides this module the package is used from core/windows too.
          Classes contained in the package are rather
          general and therefore this package could be moved in the future. It is placed here only due to current
          modules dependencies. Consequently the package is not intended for external use.<br> For more

<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
	The tab control is a swing control used by NetBeans window system, similar in function to a JTabbedPane, which
        allows the user to see and select tabs that contain different components.  It defines two GUI components:
        TabbedContainer (similar to JTabbedPane) and TabDisplayer, a generic component for displaying tabs which 
        is not associated with any particular container.  Several different types of UIs (view, editor, sliding)
        are provided, each of which is handled by a different UI delegate class; UI delegate subclasses designed
        to fit with Windows, Metal, Aqua and GTK look and feels are provided.

          Classes contained in the package are rather
          general and therefore this package could be moved in the future. It is placed here only due to current

            Describe the overall architecture. 
            
        </em></font>
<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
The Swing components in this package were carefully designed to be consistent with standard Swing components in their
function, usage and ui registration mechanisms.

            to use the module?
        </em></font>
<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
Primary use cases are in the NetBeans window system, as top level containers in the main window;  future use cases
include providing a consistent UI for tabs in the property sheet, the component inspector and the output window, but
this probably will not happen for 4.0.

<b>Answer:</b>
        The displayed tabs are contained in a data model provided by the client.
        The "user object" of each element in the model may be a 
        Component instance, or something else (in which case the client code must
        supply a ComponentConverter instance to find the correct component when
        an element is selected).  The default implementation tests if the user
        object is a Component (which it always should be currently for NetBeans
        window system - a system of lazy loading of opened components based on
        ID's may be implemented in the future), and if it is not, returns null.

<b>Answer:</b>
	No.  Different GUI types have different scalability characterisitics, in

        very lightweight and scalable, as there may be many; view tabs are less
        scalable (but the ui design for view tabs also doesn't scale - all tabs
        are displayed in a row and clipped if they don't fit); sliding tabs,

It is highly unlikely that any look and feel will provide its own UI delegates for the tab control.

            public?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to
            public classes of your module from other modules. This prevents
            unwanted dependencies of others on your code and should be used
            whenever possible (<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/download/apis/org/openide/doc-files/upgrade.html#3.4-public-packages">

            <hint>
            Installation location shall not matter, if it does explain why.
            Consider also whether <code>InstalledFileLocator</code> can help.

            of any of your components?
            
            <hint>
            Often <code>JComponent.getClientProperty</code>, <code>Action.getValue</code>
            or <code>PropertyDescriptor.getValue</code>, etc. are used to influence
            a behaviour of some code. This of course forms an interface that should
            be documented. Also if one depends on some interface that an object
            implements (<code>component instanceof Runnable</code>) that forms an
            API as well.

            <hint>
            If there is a property that can change the behaviour of your 
            code, somebody will likely use it. You should describe what it does 
            and the stability category of this API. You may use
            <pre>
                &lt;property name=&quot;id&quot; category=&quot;private&quot; >
                    description of the property, where it is used, what it influence, etc.

            Does your code use Java Reflection to execute other code?
            <hint>
            This usually indicates a missing or unsufficient API in the other
            part of the system. If the other side is not aware of your dependency
            this contract can be easily broken.

<!--
        <question id="perf-progress">
            Does your module execute any long-running tasks?
            <hint>Typically they are tasks like connecting over
            network, computing huge amount of data, compilation.
            Such communication should be done asynchronously (for example
            using <code>RequestProcessor</code>), definitively it should 
            not block AWT thread.
            </hint>

<!--
        <question id="perf-scale">

            Does your module use <code>java.io.File</code> directly?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the prefered
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when
            this is not suitable.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
    



<!--
        <question id="resources-layer">
            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create any files or
            folders in it? What it is trying to communicate by that and with which 
            components?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.).

<!--
        <question id="resources-mask">
            Does your module mask/hide/override any resources provided by other modules in
            their layers?
            
            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.
            </hint>
        </question>

<!--
        <question id="resources-read">
            Does your module read any resources from layers? For what purpose?
            
            <hint>
            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.
            Please describe it and clasify according to 
            <a href="http://openide.netbeans.org/tutorial/api-design.html#categories">
            common stability categories</a>.

<!--
        <question id="exec-introspection">
            Does your module use any kind of runtime type information (<code>instanceof</code>,
            work with <code>java.lang.Class</code>, etc.)?
            <hint>
            Check for cases when you have an object of type A and you also
            expect it to (possibly) be of type B and do some special action. That
            should be documented. The same applies on operations in meta-level
            (Class.isInstance(...), Class.isAssignableFrom(...), etc.).
            </hint>
        </question>

<!--
        <question id="exec-process">
            Do you execute an external process from your module? How do you ensure
            that the result is the same on different platforms? Do you parse output?
            Do you depend on result code?
            <hint>
            If you feed an input, parse the output please declare that as an API.
            </hint>

Please increment the 'version' field of <api-questions> whenever you make a
semantic change: adding a new question or significantly changing the meaning of
an old one. Changing this field ensures that arch pages answering the old version
print a warning during Javadoc generation. If you only change hints or make small
edits in the text of a question, you need not change the version number.

An automated process runs openide/www/tutorial/build.xml#question periodically
and commits any changes to openide/www/tutorial/questions.html.

<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
The

        </em></font>

<b>Answer:</b>

There is a <a href="../org-openide-dialogs/org/openide/doc-files/wizard-guidebook.html" shape="rect">Wizard Guide Book</a>
providing the introductionary information, moreover here is a list
of frequently asked questions and their answers:

<h4>How to change the title of a wizard?</h4>
  
<em>
  <b>Q:</b> Although none of my panels have names set (using setName() method) and the method name() in the WizardDescriptor.Iterator 
  returns an empty string, I'm getting "wizard ( )" as the title of each panel in my wizard. 
  When I set the name of the panel and return a string from the method name() I get: "panelName wizard (myName)".
  The wizard steps are labeled correctly, it just the panel title/name that looks like it adds "wizard ()" to 
  any of my panels. I don't mind the "( )", but I would like to rid of the word "wizard". 
  </em>
  
<p>
  
<b>A:</b> You can change the format of your wizard's title by 
  <a href="org/openide/WizardDescriptor.html#setTitleFormat-java.text.MessageFormat-" shape="rect">WizardDescriptor.setTitleFormat(MessageFormat format)</a>
  and rid of 'wizard' word in the default wizard's title.

<!--
        <question id="compat-i18n">
            Is your module correctly internationalized?
            <hint>
            Correct internationalization means that it obeys instuctions 
            at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/devhome/docs/i18n/index.html">
            NetBeans I18N pages</a>.

<!--
        <question id="compat-standards">
            Does the module implement or define any standards? Is the 
            implementation exact or does it deviate somehow?
        </question>

<!--
        <question id="compat-version">
            Can your module coexist with earlier and future
            versions? Can you correctly read all old settings? Will future
            versions be able to read your current settings? Can you read
            or politely ignore settings stored by a future version?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.

            <hint>
            It is expected that if your module runs on 1.x that it will run 
            on 1.x+1 if no, state that please. Also describe here cases where
            you run different code on different versions of JRE and why.

            What other projects outside NetBeans does this one depend on?
            
            <hint>
            Some non-NetBeans projects are packaged as NetBeans modules
            (see <a href="http://libs.netbeans.org">libraries</a>) and
            it is prefered to use this approach when more modules may
            depend on such third-party library.

<!--
        <question id="dep-platform">
            On which platforms does your module run? Does it run in the same

            <hint>
            If your module consist just from one module JAR file, just confirm that.
            If it uses more than one JAR, describe where there are located, how
            they refer to each other. 
            If it consist of module JAR(s) and other files, please describe
            what is their purpose, why other files are necessary. Please 
            make sure that installation/deinstallation leaves the system

            <hint>
            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to
            public classes of your module from other modules. This prevents
            unwanted dependencies of others on your code and should be used

            <hint>
            Installation location shall not matter, if it does explain why.

            Often <code>JComponent.getClientProperty</code>, <code>Action.getValue</code>
            or <code>PropertyDescriptor.getValue</code>, etc. are used to influence
            a behaviour of some code. This of course forms an interface that should
            be documented. Also if one depends on some interface that an object
            implements (<code>component instanceof Runnable</code>) that forms an
            API as well.

            Is execution of your code influenced by any environment or
            Java system (<code>System.getProperty</code>) property?
            
            <hint>
            If there is a property that can change the behaviour of your 
            code, somebody will likely use it. You should describe what it does 
            and the stability category of this API. You may use
            <pre>
                &lt;property name=&quot;id&quot; category=&quot;private&quot; &gt;
                    description of the property, where it is used, what it influence, etc.

<!--
        <question id="exec-reflection">
            Does your code use Java Reflection to execute other code?
            <hint>
            This usually indicates a missing or unsufficient API in the other
            part of the system. If the other side is not aware of your dependency
            this contract can be easily broken.

            Such communication should be done asynchronously (for example
            using <code>RequestProcessor</code>), definitively it should

            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the prefered
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when
            this is not suitable.
            </hint>

<!--
        <question id="resources-layer">
            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create any files or

            components?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.).

            their layers?
            
            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file&apos;s name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.

<!--
        <question id="resources-read">
            Does your module read any resources from layers? For what purpose?
            
            <hint>
            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.
            Please describe it and clasify according to 
            <a href="http://openide.netbeans.org/tutorial/api-design.html#categories">

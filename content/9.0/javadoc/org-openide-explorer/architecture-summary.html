<p></p>
        Setting this property to integer number controls prefetching of nodes
        when VisualizerChildren are constructed (prefetchCount = 0 disables
        prefetching).
        The prefetching should eliminate "bounce" effect (see #144718) in lazy 
        implementation which is caused by the fact that there exist keys without
        nodes. In such case "dummy" nodes are created and remove event is fired.
        This undesirable effect is eliminated by prefetching selected number of 
        nodes so "dummy" nodes are detected and removed in advance before any 
        visualization occurs.

            What is this project good for?

<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>

    The 
    <a href="#java-ExplorerAPI">ExplorerAPI</a>
    is build around Explorer - solely a user-interface device: it has no particular knowledge 
    of the structure of the IDE. Rather, it provides the physical user interface for 
    the Node hierarchy, as described in the 
    <a href="#java-NodesAPI">NodesAPI</a>.

    A given Explorer instance will be some visual component (such as a Swing panel) 
    displaying some representation of a subtree of the complete Node hierarchy; 
    the topmost node being displayed is said to be the root of the Explorer. 
    Be careful not to confuse the root of a particular Explorer instance, which is 
    selected according to what the user wishes to see, with the root(s) of 
    the entire Node hierarchy, which generally are fixed.

            What other NetBeans projects and modules does this one depend on?

<b>Answer:</b>
The project needs <a href="#java-NodesAPI" shape="rect">Nodes API</a> and 
    <a href="#java-UtilitiesAPI">UtilitiesAPI</a> 
which are essential for it to run. Beyond that it uses runtime 
checks for presence of other APIs (PENDING) to use their 
features for backward compatibility.

<b>Answer:</b>
    <a href="#systemproperty-org.openide.explorer.VisualizerNode.prefetchCount">org.openide.explorer.VisualizerNode.prefetchCount</a>
            - 
        Setting this property to integer number controls prefetching of nodes
        when VisualizerChildren are constructed (prefetchCount = 0 disables
        prefetching).
        The prefetching should eliminate "bounce" effect (see #144718) in lazy 
        implementation which is caused by the fact that there exist keys without
        nodes. In such case "dummy" nodes are created and remove event is fired.
        This undesirable effect is eliminated by prefetching selected number of 
        nodes so "dummy" nodes are detected and removed in advance before any 
        visualization occurs.

        <question id="compat-i18n">
            Is your module correctly internationalized?
            <hint>
            Correct internationalization means that it obeys instuctions 
            at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/devhome/docs/i18n/index.html">

<!--
        <question id="compat-version">
            Can your module coexist with earlier and future
            versions of itself? Can you correctly read all old settings? Will future
            versions be able to read your current settings? Can you read
            or politely ignore settings stored by a future version?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.

            Some non-NetBeans projects are packaged as NetBeans modules
            (see <a href="http://libs.netbeans.org">libraries</a>) and
            it is prefered to use this approach when more modules may

            If it uses more than one JAR, describe where they are located, how
            they refer to each other.

            <hint>
            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to

            Often <code>JComponent.getClientProperty</code>, <code>Action.getValue</code>
            or <code>PropertyDescriptor.getValue</code>, etc. are used to influence
            a behaviour of some code. This of course forms an interface that should

            <hint>
            If there is a property that can change the behaviour of your 
            code, somebody will likely use it. You should describe what it does 
            and the stability category of this API. You may use

            Such communication should be done asynchronously (for example

            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the prefered
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when
            this is not suitable.

            components?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of

            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.

        <question id="deploy-dependencies" when="final">
            What do other modules need to do to declare a dependency on this one,
            in addition to or instead of the normal module dependency declaration
            (e.g. tokens to require)?
            <hint>
                Provide a sample of the actual lines you would add to a module manifest
                to declare a dependency, for example OpenIDE-Module-Requires: some.token.
                If other modules should not depend on this module, or should just use a
                simple regular module dependency, you can just answer "nothing". If you
                intentionally expose a semistable API to clients using implementation
                dependencies, you should mention that here (but there is no need to give
                an example of usage).

<!--
        <question id="exec-ant-tasks" when="impl">
            Do you define or register any ant tasks that other can use?
            
            <hint>
            If you provide an ant task that users can use, you need to be very
            careful about its syntax and behaviour, as it most likely forms an
	          API for end users and as there is a lot of end users, their reaction
            when such API gets broken can be pretty strong.

<!--
        <question id="exec-threading" when="init">
            What threading models, if any, does your module adhere to? How the
            project behaves with respect to threading?
            <hint>
                Is your API threadsafe? Can it be accessed from any threads or
                just from some dedicated ones? Any special relation to AWT and
                its Event Dispatch thread? Also
                if your module calls foreign APIs which have a specific threading model,
                indicate how you comply with the requirements for multithreaded access
                (synchronization, mutexes, etc.) applicable to those APIs.
                If your module defines any APIs, or has complex internal structures
                that might be used from multiple threads, declare how you protect
                data against concurrent access, race conditions, deadlocks, etc.,
                and whether such rules are enforced by runtime warnings, errors, assertions, etc.
                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might
                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex
                (and may or may not automatically acquire that mutex on behalf of a client method);
                might be able to run only in the event queue; etc.
                Also describe when any events are fired: synchronously, asynchronously, etc.

<!--
        <question id="perf-spi" when="init">
            How the performance of the plugged in code will be enforced?
            <hint>
            If you allow foreign code to be plugged into your own module, how
            do you enforce that it will behave correctly and quickly and will not
            negatively influence the performance of your own module?

<!--
        <question id="resources-preferences" when="final">
            Does your module uses preferences via Preferences API? Does your module use NbPreferences or
            or regular JDK Preferences ? Does it read, write or both ? 
            Does it share preferences with other modules ? If so, then why ?
            <hint>
                You may use
                    &lt;api type="export" group="preferences"
                    name="preference node name" category="private"&gt;
                    description of individual keys, where it is used, what it
                    influences, whether the module reads/write it, etc.
                    &lt;/api&gt;
                Due to XML ID restrictions, rather than /org/netbeans/modules/foo give the "name" as org.netbeans.modules.foo.
                Note that if you use NbPreferences this name will then be the same as the code name base of the module.

<!--
        <question id="security-grant" when="final">
            Does your code grant additional rights to some other code?
            <hint>Avoid using a class loader that adds extra
            permissions to loaded code unless really necessary.
            Also note that your API implementation
            can also expose unneeded permissions to enemy code by
            calling AccessController.doPrivileged().</hint>

<!--
        <question id="security-policy" when="final">
            Does your functionality require modifications to the standard policy file?
            <hint>Your code might pass control to third-party code not
            coming from trusted domains. This could be code downloaded over the
            network or code coming from libraries that are not bundled
            with NetBeans. Which permissions need to be granted to which domains?</hint>

Please increment the 'version' field of <api-questions> whenever you make a
semantic change: adding a new question or significantly changing the meaning of
an old one. Changing this field ensures that arch pages answering the old version
print a warning during Javadoc generation. If you only change hints or make small
edits in the text of a question, you need not change the version number.

An automated process runs openide/www/tutorial/build.xml#question periodically

<h2>General Information</h2>

<font color="gray"><b><a name="answer-arch-what">Question (arch-what)</a>:</b><em>
            What is this project good for?
            
        </em></font>
<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
The Input/Output API is a small API module
which contains <code>InputOutput</code> and related interfaces used in
driving the Output Window. The normal implementation is <code>org.netbeans.core.output2</code>.
<p></p>
<font color="gray"><b><a name="answer-arch-overall">Question (arch-overall)</a>:</b><em>

            Describe the main <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/API_Design#The_Importance_of_Being_Use_Case_Oriented" shape="rect">
            use cases</a> of the new API. Who will use it under
            what circumstances? What kind of code would typically need to be written
            to use the module?
        </em></font>
<p></p>
<b>Answer:</b>
  
<p>There is an SPI but additional implementations are not expected. The API is most important.</p>
  
<p>
   Simple usage example:
  </p>

<pre xml:space="preserve">

<span class="type">InputOutput</span> <span class="variable-name">io</span> = IOProvider.getDefault().getIO(<span class="string">"My Window"</span>, true);
io.select();
<span class="type">OutputWriter</span> <span class="variable-name">w</span> = io.getOut();
w.println(<span class="string">"Line of plain text."</span>);
<span class="type">OutputListener</span> <span class="variable-name">listener</span> = <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="type">OutputListener</span>() {
    <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span class="function-name">outputLineAction</span>(<span class="type">OutputEvent</span> <span class="variable-name">ev</span>) {
        StatusDisplayer.getDefault().setStatusText(<span class="string">"Hyperlink clicked!"</span>);
    }
    <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span class="function-name">outputLineSelected</span>(<span class="type">OutputEvent</span> <span class="variable-name">ev</span>) {
        <span class="comment">// Let's not do anything special.
</span>    }
    <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span class="function-name">outputLineCleared</span>(<span class="type">OutputEvent</span> <span class="variable-name">ev</span>) {
        <span class="comment">// Leave it blank, no state to remove.
</span>    }
};
w.println(<span class="string">"Line of hyperlinked text."</span>, listener, true);

<p>
   Done.

            <hint>
            This usually indicates a missing or unsufficient API in the other
            part of the system. If the other side is not aware of your dependency
            this contract can be easily broken.

            Such communication should be done asynchronously (for example
            using <code>RequestProcessor</code>), definitively it should

            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the prefered
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when
            this is not suitable.

<!--
        <question id="resources-layer">
            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create any files or

            components?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.).

            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file&apos;s name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.

            Does your module read any resources from layers? For what purpose?
            
            <hint>
            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.

            <a href="http://openide.netbeans.org/tutorial/api-design.html#categories">

            <hint>
            Check for cases when you have an object of type A and you also
            expect it to (possibly) be of type B and do some special action. That
            should be documented. The same applies on operations in meta-level

            <hint>
            If you provide an ant task that users can use, you need to be very
            careful about its syntax and behaviour, as it most likely forms an
	          API for end users and as there is a lot of end users, their reaction
            when such API gets broken can be pretty strong.

<!--
        <question id="exec-threading" when="impl">
            What threading models, if any, does your module adhere to?
            <hint>
                If your module calls foreign APIs which have a specific threading model,
                indicate how you comply with the requirements for multithreaded access
                (synchronization, mutexes, etc.) applicable to those APIs.
                If your module defines any APIs, or has complex internal structures
                that might be used from multiple threads, declare how you protect
                data against concurrent access, race conditions, deadlocks, etc.,
                and whether such rules are enforced by runtime warnings, errors, assertions, etc.
                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might
                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex
                (and may or may not automatically acquire that mutex on behalf of a client method);
                might be able to run only in the event queue; etc.
                Also describe when any events are fired: synchronously, asynchronously, etc.

            Does your code grant additional rights to some other code?
            <hint>Avoid using a class loader that adds extra
            permissions to loaded code unless really necessary.
            Also note that your API implementation
            can also expose unneeded permissions to enemy code by

        <question id="security-policy" when="final">
            Does your functionality require modifications to the standard policy file?
            <hint>Your code might pass control to third-party code not
            coming from trusted domains. This could be code downloaded over the
            network or code coming from libraries that are not bundled
            with NetBeans. Which permissions need to be granted to which domains?</hint>
